# NFCPassportReader

This app demonstrates how to read in data from an E-Passport using the iOS 13 CoreNFC APIs

Supported features:
* Basic Access Control (BAC)
* Secure Messaging
* Reads DG1 (MRZ data) and DG2 (Image) in both JPEG and JPEG2000 formats

This is a demonstration - the code is by no means perfect (its still pretty rough TBH).  I've just been trying to get it working - there ARE most definately bugs and I'm sure I'm not doing things perfectly. 

It reads my passport (and others I've been able to test) fine, however your milage may vary.

I'd like to thank the writers of pypassport (Jean-Francois Houzard and Olivier Roger - can't find their website but referenced from https://github.com/andrew867/epassportviewer) who's work this is based on.
